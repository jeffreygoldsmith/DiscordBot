# Jekbot

A discord bot that uses Discord.js for my personal use that has arbitrary functions.

##Setup

1. Download this repository using the green download button and put it onto your desktop
2. Install the current Nodejs build using this link: https://nodejs.org/en/
3. Once installed, open Terminal or Command Prompt
4. Navigate to the repository folder on your desktop using the command prompt. Use the `cd` (change directory) and `ls` (list files in current directory, for PC this command is `dir`) commands to get to your desktop. If you have trouble watch a video on the topic: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+navigate+terminal. Once you are in the directory of the repository, your terminal should say something like this: '~/Desktop/github/DiscordBot'.
5. Now type `npm install` into the terminal and press enter
6. Once this command finishes running type `npm start` to run the bot!
